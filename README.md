# Overview

This repository demonstraits a simple ecommerse program. The ecommerse program was originally created in a language I'm familiar with, Python, which I transalated into Java for learning purposes.


# Development Environment

I created both programs in Visual Studio Code

I used 'ArrayList' in the Java program to enable custom classes to be saved within strings

# Useful Websites

I have found these websites helpful for understand Java:

* [Java Web Toutor](https://javawebtutor.com/articles/corejava/arraylist-of-custom-class-object.php)
* [Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/java-printstream-printf)
* [W3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/java/default.asp)

# Future Work

I plan on adding to the Python and Java ecommerse program where a customer creates an account with an username and password while demonstraighting more complex OOP in both languages.
